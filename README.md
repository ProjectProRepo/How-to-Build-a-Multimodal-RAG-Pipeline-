# How-to-Build-a-Multimodal-RAG-Pipeline-
This guide walks through building a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain and OpenAI’s GPT-4 Vision model. The pipeline extracts text, tables, and images from PDFs, summarizes them, stores them in a vector database, and retrieves relevant multimodal content to answer user queries.

# **Overview**  
This **multimodal RAG pipeline** enables efficient document-based retrieval for **financial analysis, medical research, and other domains** requiring multimodal understanding.  

## **Installation**  
Install the required dependencies for text parsing, embedding, and multimodal processing:  
- `LangChain`  
- `OpenAI`  
- `ChromaDB`  
- `Unstructured`  

## **File Structure**  
The repository is organized as follows:  

    Multimodal-RAG/  
    ├── MultimodalRAG.ipynb     # Main notebook implementing the pipeline  
    ├── cj/                     # Directory containing external documents and images  
        ├── cj.pdf              # PDF document to process  
        ├── figure-10-1.jpg     # Image files for multimodal retrieval

## **Key Steps in the Pipeline**  

### **1. Extracting PDF Elements**  
- Uses `partition_pdf()` to extract **text, tables, and images** while preserving table structures.  
- Large text blocks are intelligently chunked for efficient processing.  

### **2. Categorizing Extracted Elements**  
- Extracted content is classified as **text** or **tables** to ensure accurate retrieval.  

### **3. Splitting Text for Embeddings**  
- Text is chunked into **4,000-token segments** to optimize retrieval and embedding in the vector store.  

### **4. Generating Summaries**  
- Summaries for text and tables are created using **GPT-4**, enhancing retrieval efficiency.  

### **5. Processing Images**  
- Images are **encoded in Base64**, stored, and summarized using **GPT-4 Vision** for retrieval.  

### **6. Creating a Multi-Vector Retriever**  
- A **retriever indexes the summaries** and links them to their original content (text, tables, images) for precise retrieval.  

### **7. Handling Multimodal Queries**  
- Text and images are retrieved, structured into a **financial analysis prompt**, and processed with **GPT-4 Vision** for intelligent insights.  

### **8. Running and Validating the Pipeline**  
- The system retrieves **investment-related insights** using financial metrics (**EV/NTM, revenue growth, etc.**) by fetching relevant text and images.

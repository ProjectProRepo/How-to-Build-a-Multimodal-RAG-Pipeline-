# How-to-Build-a-Multimodal-RAG-Pipeline-
This guide walks through building a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain and OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 Vision model. The pipeline extracts text, tables, and images from PDFs, summarizes them, stores them in a vector database, and retrieves relevant multimodal content to answer user queries.

# Overview
This multimodal RAG pipeline enables efficient document-based retrieval for financial analysis, medical research, and other domains requiring multimodal understanding.
## Installing Dependencies
- Required packages like LangChain, OpenAI, ChromaDB, and unstructured are installed for text parsing, embedding, and multimodal capabilities.
## Extracting PDF Elements
- The partition_pdf() function extracts text, tables, and images, preserving table structures and chunking large text blocks.
## Categorizing Extracted Elements
- Extracted content is classified as text or tables for further processing.
## Splitting Text for Embeddings
- Text is chunked (4,000 tokens per piece) to optimize retrieval and embedding in the vector store.
## Generating Summaries
- Summaries are created for text and tables using GPT-4, improving retrieval efficiency.
## Processing Images
- Images are encoded into Base64, stored, and summarized using GPT-4 Vision.
## Creating a Multi-Vector Retriever
- A retriever indexes the summaries while linking them to original content (text, tables, or images) for retrieval.
## Handling Multimodal Queries
- Text and images are retrieved, structured into a financial analysis prompt, and sent to GPT-4 Vision for intelligent responses.
## Running and Validating the Pipeline
- The system retrieves investment-related information using financial metrics (EV/NTM, revenue growth, etc.), retrieving relevant text and images for insights.
